## Questions

How can we take our extremely obvious intuition and apply it to a large set
of data like this? Some boundaries are easy to draw. I'm pretty sure my car
never went 1,000 miles per hour, so if we see that, it's safe to say that we
can mark some points as invalid. But our intuition is much more detailed than
this.
